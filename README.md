# Playlist for Two

Playlist for Two is a social music discovery app integrated with Spotify that enables users to generate playlists based on common songs, artists, and genres using Spotify's recommendation engine. The mobile client for the app is cross-platform (ios/Android) and was built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
